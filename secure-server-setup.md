### SETUP SECURE SERVERS FOR ANSIBLE
The first configuration to be performed on any new server—especially any server
with any exposure (direct or indirect) to the public Internet)—is security configuration.
There are nine basic measures to ensure servers are secure from unauthorized access
or intercepted communications:
1. Use secure and encrypted communication.
2. Disable root login and use sudo.
3. Remove unused software, open only required ports.
4. Use the principle of least privilege.
5. Update the OS and installed software.
6. Use a properly-configured firewall.
7. Make sure log files are populated and rotated.
8. Monitor logins and block suspect IP addresses.
9. Use SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux).
